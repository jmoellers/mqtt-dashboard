    class FixedGridLayout
    QGridView with fixed size cells, MUST be constructed with at least column width, row height and
    parent QWidget* are optional. addItem() and addLayout() methods are made private so that only
    widgets can be added, because only widgets can have fixed sizes, and that is required for this
    class to work properly. If a layout needs to be added, just create a QWidget and use setLayout()
    to give it your desired layout, then add the widget to FixedGridLayout.
    IMPORTANT! When using this class it's VERY important that you don't
    manually set the size of widgets being inserted, otherwise the outcome will not be as expected.
